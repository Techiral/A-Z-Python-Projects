# HoroscopeBot

## Overview

HoroscopeBot is a simple Python script that provides daily horoscope messages based on the user's zodiac sign. This script serves as a basic demonstration and does not fetch real horoscope data from an API. Instead, it generates random horoscope messages for each zodiac sign. This example is intended for educational purposes and can be a starting point for creating more advanced chatbots that integrate with real horoscope services.

## Usage

To use the HoroscopeBot, follow these steps:

1. Run the Python script in your preferred Python environment.
2. The bot will welcome you and prompt you to enter your zodiac sign.
3. Enter your zodiac sign (e.g., "Leo") when prompted.
4. The bot will provide your zodiac sign's date range and a random horoscope message.
5. You can enter other zodiac signs or type "quit" to exit the bot.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this HoroscopeBot is for demonstration purposes only and does not provide actual horoscope predictions. To create a functional horoscope bot with real data, you would need to integrate it with a reliable horoscope API or service.

Feel free to explore and modify this script for your educational or fun purposes. Have a great time experimenting with chatbot development!

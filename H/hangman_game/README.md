# Hangman Game

This is a simple command-line Hangman game in Python. Try to guess the hidden word letter by letter. You have a limited number of lives to use, and if you run out of lives before guessing the word correctly, you lose. If you guess the word before running out of lives, you win!

# How to Play

- Run the script using a Python interpreter.
- You will be given a word to guess, represented by underscores ('\_') that match the length of the word.
- You have 6 lives to start with.
- Enter a letter as your guess.
- If the letter you guessed is in the word, the letter will be revealed.
- If the letter you guessed is not in the word, you will lose a life.
- You cannot guess the same letter twice.
- Keep guessing letters until you:
- Guess the word correctly and win the game.
- Run out of lives and lose the game.

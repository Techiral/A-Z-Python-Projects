# Jigsaw Puzzle Solver

This is a Python program for solving jigsaw puzzles using OpenCV. It takes a set of puzzle piece images as input and arranges them to form the complete puzzle.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You also need to install the OpenCV library, which can be installed using pip:

pip install opencv-python


### Usage

1. Add your jigsaw puzzle piece images to the project directory.
2. Update the `puzzle_pieces` list in the code with the file paths of your puzzle piece images.
3. Run the `jigsaw_puzzle_solver.py` script.

The script will arrange the puzzle pieces and display the completed puzzle.

### Customization

You may need to customize the `match_pieces` function to implement more advanced image matching techniques, depending on your puzzle images.

### Example

In the provided code, we perform a simple matching by resizing the puzzle pieces. For more complex puzzles, consider using feature matching, edge detection, or other computer vision techniques for better results.

# Computes the MD5 hash of a given string using the MD5 algorithm.

# The MD5 algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value.

# It is commonly used for verifying data integrity and detecting tampering in digital signatures, message authentication codes, and other applications.

# This implementation uses the hashlib library in Python to compute the MD5 hash of the input string.

# For more information on the MD5 algorithm, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5.

# To run this script, run the following command in a terminal:

# python hashing.py

# The output of this script should look like this:

# The MD5 hash of "Hello World" is: ed076287532e86365e841e92bfc50d8c

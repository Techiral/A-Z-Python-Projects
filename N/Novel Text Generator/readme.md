# Novel Text Generator

This Python script is a simple implementation of a novel text generator using Markov Chains. It generates text based on a source text file you provide. While it won't produce high-quality novel text, it can serve as a starting point for text generation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- A source text file (your_novel_source.txt)

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Place your source text file (e.g., `your_novel_source.txt`) in the same directory as the script.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script and source text file.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python novel_text_generator.py

In order to be successful one needs cultivate and develop certain basic qualities. Success is, quite simply, the accomplishment of a predetermined goal. We consciously or subconsciously set goals for ourselves all the time. First of all, you must know aim and objective of your life. Unless you know your destination, you cannot set out on a journey. At first, you must by very clear in your objectives to be achieved. Finally, you should enjoy the overall process rather than the final outcome. There is no shortcut to success. Hard work is the only key to achieving it; it teaches us discipline, dedication and determination. There is no single right way to be successful. What works for you might not work for someone else.

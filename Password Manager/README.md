# PasswordManager
In this project, I'll create a simple password manager using Python that allows users to securely store and retrieve passwords for different accounts. The program will use encryption to protect passwords, so they're not stored in plain text.

Explanation:

    The PasswordManager class is the main component of the program, which is initialized with a randomly generated 128-bit key for AES encryption.
    The add_account method takes two arguments: the name of the account and the password for that account. It encrypts the password using AES encryption with a unique nonce and tag generated for each encryption, and stores the encrypted password, nonce, and tag in the accounts dictionary.
    The get_password method takes the name of an account and returns the decrypted password for that account, using the nonce and tag generated during encryption to ensure the password is decrypted correctly.

This password manager is just a simple example of a cybersecurity project that uses encryption to protect sensitive data. Keep in mind that it's important to follow best practices for secure coding and to thoroughly test your code to ensure it's free from vulnerabilities.

        "Logistic regression is often used to predict the probability of binary or multinomial outcomes. it can be multinomial(where more than two outcomes are also possible).\n",
        "Class separation is complex in a multinomial class classification model.\n",
        "A logistic regression model assumes a logarithmic relationship between the dependent and independent variables, while a linear regression model assumes a linear relationship. \n",
        "The variable of interest in many real-life settings is categorical: The purchase or non-purchase of a product, the approval or non-approval of a credit card, or the cancerousness of a tumor.\n",
        "Logistic regression can estimate the likelihood of a case belonging to a specific level in the dependant variable. \n",
        "The logistic regression model can be explained using the following equation:\n",
        "{Formula]\n",
        "\n",
        "The outcome's log-odds are given by the formula Ln (P/1-P).\n",
        "According to the preceding equation's beta coefficients, the outcome variable's probabilities increase or decrease by one unit when the explanatory variable rises or falls. \n",
        "The interpretation of a logistic regression model differs significantly from the interpretation of a linear regression model.\n",
        "The right-hand side equation's weighted sum is turned into a probability value. The log-odds are used to describe the value on the left side of the equation. \n",
        "It is termed the log odds because it represents the ratio of an event occurring to the probability of an event not occurring.\n",
        "To comprehend the logistic regression model and how decisions are made, it is necessary to grasp the concepts of probabilities and odds.\n",

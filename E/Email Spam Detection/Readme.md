# Oasis-DS-Internship-task_04

## Aim:
To create a machine learning-based spam detector for email.

## Approach:
Building 3 classification models in Python and identifying which works the best for our data.

The 3 models used are:

1. Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier

Used voting classifier to predict the results based on the findings of each estimator. The results for each model are analysed using Confusion matrix and Classification Report.

## Libraries used:
1. numpy 
2. pandas
3. nltk 
4. matplotlib 
5. seaborn

# Koch Snowflake Fractal

## Introduction

This Python script generates a beautiful fractal pattern known as the Koch Snowflake using the Turtle graphics library. The Koch Snowflake is a self-replicating structure with intricate detail, and it demonstrates the fascinating concept of recursive patterns in mathematics and computer science.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

1. Open a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) and create a new Python file.

2. Copy and paste the provided code into the file.

3. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `koch_snowflake.py`.

4. Open your terminal or command prompt.

5. Navigate to the directory where you saved the script using the `cd` command.

6. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python koch_snowflake.py
```

## Customization
    order: Adjust this value to change the complexity of the snowflake. A higher value will create a more intricate snowflake.

    size: Change this value to set the initial size of the snowflake. A larger size will result in a bigger snowflake.

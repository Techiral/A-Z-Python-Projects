# Organizer Tool

The Organizer Tool is a simple command-line application designed to help users manage their tasks. Leveraging the power of machine learning, the tool also predicts the priority (High, Medium, Low) of a task based on its description.

## Features:

1. **Add a Task**: Easily add tasks to your list.
2. **List All Tasks**: View all tasks in your organizer.
3. **Remove a Task**: Remove tasks that you've completed or no longer need.
4. **Predict Task Priority**: Get a machine learning-based prediction of the priority level of your task.

## Installation:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ayushnangia/organizer_tool.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd organizer_tool
   ```

## Usage:

1. Run the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to manage your tasks and predict their priorities.

## Dataset:

The machine learning model uses a small dataset (`dataset.csv`) to train itself. The dataset consists of task descriptions and their respective priorities. Feel free to expand or modify the dataset to better suit your needs.

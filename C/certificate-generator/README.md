# Generate Certificates with ease using Python!

## Important!

### Make sure you have this 3 files along with the python in folder!
- Certificate Template in png or jpeg format.
- Excel Sheet containing the data of Name and their College (College taken as example could be any other details)
- A font of your choice having format .ttf or .otf
- And ofcourse your .py python code :)


### Step 1

- First get your excel sheet with all the data loaded
- Make sure that your excel sheet should have a "Name" and "College" Column Name (College taken as example it can be anything)

### Step 2

- Make sure that you have the certificate and font downloaded and are in the same folder!

### Step 3

- In your certificate.py code
- According to your certficate template change the ``` name_X ``` and ```name_y``` variable values in the python to change the position of name text.
- ```name_x``` refers to the change in position of Name in the X axis i.e., Horizontal Movement
- ```name_y``` referes to the change in position of Name in the Y axis i.e., Vertical Movement
- This is a trial and error method. So keep trying different values so that it ultimately fits in the name portion


### Step 4

- Now just the run the certificate.py in the same folder
- You will see the certificates keep on generating :)
- Have Fun

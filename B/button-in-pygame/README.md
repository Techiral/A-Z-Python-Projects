# Pygame Button Example

This Python program demonstrates a simple GUI using the Pygame library. It creates a window with two buttons that respond to mouse clicks. When you click a button, it triggers a function.

## Prerequisites

Before running this program, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system. You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

- After running the program, a window will open with two buttons.
- The first button, "Button One (onePress)," responds to a single click.
- The second button, "Button Two (multiPress)," allows multiple clicks.

## Customization

You can customize the buttons by modifying the `Button` class in your Python code. You can change button text, dimensions, and behavior by adjusting the class constructor parameters.

## Introduction

This project is a simple blockchain implementation using Python and the Flask web framework. It provides basic functionality for creating a blockchain, mining new blocks, and checking the validity of the blockchain.

## Features

- Create new blocks with proof of work
- Mine new blocks with a simple proof of work algorithm
- Check the validity of the blockchain

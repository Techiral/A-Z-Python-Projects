## Snake Game in Python with Turtle, Time, and Random Modules

This README.md file provides instructions on how to create and run a simple Snake game in Python using the Turtle, Time, and Random modules.

Prerequisites:
* Python 3
* Turtle module
* Time module
* Random module

Installation:
To install the Turtle, Time, and Random modules, run the following command in your terminal:
`pip install turtle time random`

Creating the Snake Game:
To create the Snake game, create a new Python file and save it as `snake_game.py`. Then, add the following code to the file:

Game Start
To start the game, simply run the `snake_game.py` file: 
`python snake_game.py`

Gameplay:
The goal of the game is to control the snake using the arrow keys to eat as much food as possible without hitting itself or the borders of the screen. Every time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer. The game ends when the snake hits itself or the borders of the screen.


Keyboard Controls:
* A : For moving left
* D : For moving right
* S : For moving down
* W : For moving up


Tips and Tricks:
* Try to plan your moves ahead of time so that you don't trap yourself.
* Use the walls to your advantage to corner the food.
* Don't be afraid to eat your own tail if it means getting a piece of food.

### Conclusion:
This is a basic snake game implementation in Python using the Turtle, Time, and Random modules. You can modify the game to add more features, such as different levels, power-ups, and enemies.


### Additional Notes:
* The game speed can be adjusted by changing the delay variable in the snake_game.py file. A smaller delay value will make the game faster.
* The game difficulty can be increased by reducing the size of the game screen or by making the snake start with a longer body.
* You can add different types of food to the game by creating new turtle objects and giving them different shapes and colors.
* You can add enemies to the game by creating new turtle objects and giving them different behaviors.


Have fun !

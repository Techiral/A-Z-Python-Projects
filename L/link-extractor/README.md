    positional arguments:
    url                   The URL to extract links from.

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -m MAX_URLS, --max-urls MAX_URLS
                            Number of max URLs to crawl, default is 30.
    ```
- For instance, to extract all links from 2 first URLs appeared in github.com:
    ```
    python link_extractor.py https://github.com -m 2
    ```
    This will result in a large list, here is the last 5 links:
    ```
    [!] External link: https://developer.github.com/
    [*] Internal link: https://help.github.com/
    [!] External link: https://github.blog/
    [*] Internal link: https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/
    [*] Internal link: https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/
    [+] Total Internal links: 85
    [+] Total External links: 21
    [+] Total URLs: 106
    ```
    This will also save these URLs in `github.com_external_links.txt` for external links and `github.com_internal_links.txt` for internal links.

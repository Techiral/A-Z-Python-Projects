### File Reader

This is a simple Python program that reads and displays the content of a text file. It allows you to specify the file name, and it will display the contents of that file. The program handles common error cases more gracefully.

#### Usage

1. Run the program using a Python interpreter.
2. You will be prompted to enter the name of the file you want to read.
3. The program will then attempt to read and display the content of the specified file.
4. If the file is found and can be read, its content will be displayed.
5. If the file is not found, an error message will be shown.
6. If any other error occurs during file reading, an error message will be displayed.

#### Program Features

- Graceful handling of errors:
  - If the specified file is not found, it will display a user-friendly error message.
  - If any other error occurs during file reading, it will display an error message with details.

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

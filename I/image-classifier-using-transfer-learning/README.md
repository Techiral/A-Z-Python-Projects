# To run this:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- To train the model (already trained and the optimal weights are in `results` folder):
    ```
    python train.py
    ```
    This will load the flower dataset, construct the `MobileNetV2` model with its weights and starts training.
- 86% accuracy was achieved on 5 classes of flowers which are `daisy`, `dandelion`, `roses`, `sunflowers` and `tulips`.
- To evaluate the model as well as visualizing different flowers and its corresponding predictions:
    ```
    python test.py
    ```
    This will **Outputs:**
    ```

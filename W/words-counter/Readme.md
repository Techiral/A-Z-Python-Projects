## Words Counter in Python
This is a very simple program and we can easily use it and count our words

## Note
The word_count function takes a string text as input.<br>
Inside the function, the split method is used to break the text into words by splitting it at whitespace (spaces, tabs, and line breaks).<br>
The len function is used to count the number of words in the list. <br>
The program then takes user input using input and calls the word_count function with the provided input. <br>
Finally, it prints the word count to the console.

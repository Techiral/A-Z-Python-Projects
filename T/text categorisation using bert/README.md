The project leverages BERT and TensorFlow to train a sophisticated classification model capable of accurately categorizing text descriptions into relevant grievance categories. It aims to develop a robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) solution for categorizing customer grievances. Customer grievances can take various forms, spanning issues related to service quality, access and availability, billing disputes, benefit packages, and marketing concerns.

The project aims to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) solution for categorizing customer grievances. Customer grievances can manifest in various forms, including issues related to the quality of service, access and availability, billing/financial disputes, benefit packages, and marketing. In this project, I have trained a classification model capable of classifying text descriptions into appropriate categories and subcategories.

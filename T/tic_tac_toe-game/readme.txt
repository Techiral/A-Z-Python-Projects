Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game project! This simple Python command-line game allows two players to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Players take turns placing their symbols ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to complete a row, column, or diagonal with their symbols.

## How to Play

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the game by executing the following command:

   ```shell

Interactive Quiz Application

This Python application creates an interactive quiz using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. Players can answer a series of multiple-choice questions and test their knowledge on various topics.

Features:

Graphical User Interface: The application provides a user-friendly GUI, built using Tkinter and styled with the Plastik theme from ttkthemes.

Quiz Questions: The quiz consists of multiple-choice questions. You can easily add, edit, or remove questions by modifying the self.questions list in the code.

High Scores: The application allows players to enter their name, and it stores their high scores in a dictionary.

Sound Effects: It uses the pygame library to play sound effects for correct and incorrect answers.

Timer: Each question is timed, and the timer label displays the time left to answer each question.

Usage:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have the required dependencies (Tkinter, ttkthemes, pygame) installed.
Run the Python script, and the quiz application will start.
Answer questions, and your score will be displayed at the end of the quiz.
Feel free to customize the quiz questions or the appearance of the application to suit your needs. Enjoy playing and learning!

Note: Make sure to provide the required sound files, "correct.mp3" and "incorrect.mp3," in the same directory as the Python script or specify their correct paths.
